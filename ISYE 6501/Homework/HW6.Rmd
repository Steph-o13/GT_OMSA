### Question 9.1

#### Using the crime data set, apply Principal Component Analysis and then create a regression model using the first few principal components. Specify your new model in terms of the original variables and compare its quality to your solution to 8.2.

```{r load data}
# load data
crime_df <- read.table("uscrime.txt",  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
head(crime_df, 5)
```
First I did a PCA using all of the predictors from the crime data set. According to the analysis, the first six components explain 89.996% of the variance (with the first component by itself expaining 40.13%!).  With less and less of the variance being explained by later components, I proceeded to do the regression analysis with the first six components. 

```{r PCA}
# PCA with all predictors
crime_pca <- prcomp(x = crime_df[,1:15] 
                    , scale = TRUE
                    )
summary(crime_pca)

# graph the principal components by how much of the variance they explain
screeplot(x = crime_pca
          , npcs = 15
          ,type = "lines")
```
The most positively and negatively correlated predictors for each of the six principal components are: 

- PC1: `Wealth` | `Ineq`
- PC2: `M.F`    | `Pop`
- PC3: `LF`     | `U1`
- PC4: `Prob`   | `Time`
- PC5: `Prob`   | `M.F`
- PC6: `LF`     | `M`

```{r Regression}
print(crime_pca)

# combine the principal components with the crime data set
pca_crime_df <- as.data.frame(
                              cbind(crime_pca$x[,1:6]
                                    , crime_df[,16]
                                    )
                             )
head(pca_crime_df)

# linear regression model with principal components
lm_pca <- lm(formula = V7~.
             , data = as.data.frame(pca_crime_df)
               )

summary(lm_pca)
```
PCA found the new dimension factors and regression found the coefficients of those factors, so I can interpret the new model in terms of the original factors by calculating the implied regression coefficient for the original factors. This is the sum of the coefficients multiplied by the eigenvectors of the transformed matrix.

```{r Transformation}
# calculate the implied regression coefficient
intercept <- lm_pca$coefficients[1]
b_vector <- lm_pca$coefficients[2:6]

# matrix multiply the coefficients and the eigenvectors of the transformed matrix of data
a_vector <- crime_pca$rotation[,1:5]%*%b_vector

# get the original data set's alpha vector and coefficient vector 
mean <- sapply(crime_df[,1:15], mean)
sdv <- sapply(crime_df[,1:15], sd)
orig_b_vector <- intercept - sum(a_vector*mean/sdv)
orig_a_vector <- a_vector/sdv

# calculate the implied regression coefficient for the original predictors
implied_coefficients <- as.matrix(crime_df[,1:15]) %*% orig_a_vector+orig_b_vector

# calculate evaluation metrics
sse = sum((implied_coefficients- crime_df[,16])^2)
total_sse = sum((crime_df[,16] - mean(crime_df[,16]))^2)
rsquared <- 1 - sse/total_sse
adj_rsquared <- rsquared-(1-rsquared)*6/(nrow(crime_df)-6-1)
adj_rsquared

```
The model created with Principal Components ended up with an Adjusted R-squared value of 0.592. I compared that model performance to last week's model, which had an Adjusted R-Squared value of 0.7307. It seems like PCA didn't work quite as well as just limiting the data set only to significant predictors, but that may be due to the small size of the data set. I expect PCA would work comparably well with a larger data set.
